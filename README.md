# üîê Azure Networking Lab: NSGs & Secure Storage Access  
A hands-on Azure lab focused on configuring Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control traffic to a public subnet using the Azure Portal.  
Includes secure access to a storage account using service endpoints and firewall rules.

## üß† Key Learnings  
- Created one subnet:  
  - **Public Subnet**: Hosts the web server  
- Configured NSG rules to:  
  - ‚úÖ Allow inbound traffic on **port 80 (HTTP)** and **443 (HTTPS)** to the public subnet  
- Deployed a storage account for blob storage and restricted access to only allow traffic from within the Virtual Network using **storage firewall rules**  
- Enabled a **service endpoint for Microsoft.Storage** to allow secure access inside the virtual network to the storage account  
- Accessed blob data publicly using a **Shared Access Signature (SAS) token**  
- Remoted into the web server to install roles and features via RDP (port 3389)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- Azure Portal  
- Virtual Network (VNet) with one subnet  
- Network Security Groups (NSGs)  
- Storage Account with service endpoints  
- Windows Server VM

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Extend the lab by automating NSG setup via Azure CLI
- Explore logging and monitoring with Network Watcher
- Add CI/CD deployment for web server content

### Step 1
Create resource group.

### Step 2
Create Virtual Network with two Subnets, one public and one private.

### Step 3
Deploy first VMs for the public sub, NSG rule with port 3389 open, a NIC and a public IP address.

### Step 4
Updated NIC from dynamic to static IP as I will be adding DHCP and DNS servers to my VM.

### Step 5
RDP into VM and install following roles and features: AD DS, DHCP server, DNS server, Print and Documents Services and Web Server (IIS).

### Step 6
Storage account created with a service endpoint. Ended up adding the service endpoint from the subnets instead.

### Step 7
Attempted to access the blob via browser but failed ‚Äî despite having service endpoints enabled. Learned that service endpoints only allow access from within the virtual network. Confirmed this by running the following PowerShell script from the VM:

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://<your-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blob-name>" -OutFile "blob.jpg"

‚úÖ Blob access worked from inside the VNet, proving the firewall and service endpoint setup was correct.

### Step 8
Generated a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token to enable public access. ‚úÖ Successfully accessed the blob via browser using the SAS URL.
